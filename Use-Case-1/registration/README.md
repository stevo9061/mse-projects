The programme can be used freely.  

`mail-settings.env` must still be created in the root directory, basically an e-mail client must still be set. These values are required for this:

MAIL_ADDRESS=max@mustermann@technikum.at
MAIL_HOST=mail.example.com  
MAIL_PORT=123  
MAIL_USERNAME=max.mustermann@technikum.at  
MAIL_PASSWORD= 1234567
